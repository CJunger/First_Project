## Electric Vehicles a Washington State Analysis
Using data from Washington State we are exploring trends in electric Vehicle ownership from 2010-2020

Electric Vehicles have become more and more common in recent years. For this project we are looking at data from Washington State and the US Census API to examine the relationships and correlations between those who have chosen to purchase this newer technology. We will answer the question if the range of these vehicles has improved over time and if as it improves has this had an effect on the rate of purchase? We will examine what demographic factors are common among electric vehicle owners. We will examine which vehicles are the most popular and if that changes over time.
