## Electric Vehicles a Washington State Analysis
Using data from Washington State we are exploring trends in electric Vehicle ownership from 2010-2020

Electric Vehicles have become more and more common in recent years. For this project we are looking at data from Washington State and the US Census API to examine the relationships and correlations between those who have chosen to purchase this newer technology. We will answer the question if the range of these vehicles has improved over time and if as it improves has this had an effect on the rate of purchase? We will examine what demographic factors are common among electric vehicle owners. We will examine which vehicles are the most popular and if that changes over time. 

## Improvements of Range
From the data set provided the results are that newer vehicles do have further battery range. In the years 2010 - 2013 the average battery range was 439.58 miles, in 2014 - 2017 the range was 391.56 miles, and finally in the years of 2018 - 2021 the range was 622.09 miles. As you can see as the years have gone by the average battery ranges have gone up with the exception of 2014 - 2017 which decreased by 48.02 miles. 

## What demographic factors are common among electric vehicle owners?
 Are battery powered vehicles more popular in urban areas?

Yes, there are more battery powered vehicles in urban areas than there are in rural areas.

Does income level correlate with certain brands?

No, the level of income does not correlate with a specific brand. However, from 2010 - 2017 the Nissan Leaf was by far the best seller until the Tesla Model 3 came out in 2017.   

## Types of Electric Vehicles (EV or PHEV):

Electric Vehicles (EV): EVs are fully electric vehicles that run solely on electricity and do not have an internal combustion engine.
Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV): PHEVs are electric vehicles that have both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine. They can operate on electricity and switch to gasoline when the battery is depleted.

## Top EV and PHEV Manufacturers:

Tesla: Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y
Nissan: Leaf
Chevrolet: Volt (PHEV), Bolt EV
Ford: Fusion Energi (PHEV), Focus Electric
Toyota: Prius Prime (PHEV)
BMW: i3, i8 (PHEV)

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

This project offers an overview of the electric vehicle market in Washington, covering more than a decade of data from 2010 to 2021. While this project only covers data up to 2021, it also provides a glimpse into the future outlook for electric vehicles in Washington, projecting continued growth and opportunities in the market.

### How to use?
Personal Vehicle Purchase:
If you are considering purchasing an electric vehicle in Washington, the project can help you understand the trends in EV over the past decade. You can use the data on the types of electric vehicles, makes and models, and mile ranges to make a decision about which electric vehicle might best suit your needs and budget.

Infrastructure Development:
For companies or organizations involved in electric vehicle charging infrastructure development, the project can provide valuable information on the growth of EV in urban and rural areas of Washington. Understanding county-level data can assist in identifying regions where there might be a higher demand for charging stations.

Environmental Impact Assessment:
Anyone interested in assessing the environmental impact of electric vehicle project in Washington can use the data on EV purchases and mile ranges. This data can help estimate the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution resulting from the use of electric vehicles compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles
